# ffminus-grist-datasource

Query [Grist](https://www.getgrist.com) documents from [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).

**⚠️ Disclaimer: this plugin is unofficial, Grist Lab's only involvement was accepting the publication of this repository. ⚠️**

## Configuration

Individual Grist documents are treated as separate data sources.
This plugin assumes the Grist instance is behind a reverse proxy that mandates Basic Auth.

## Contributing

This project was meant as a one-off for personal use, and as such has a limited set of features.
Contributions are welcome, but I may have little time to devote to this repository in the future.
